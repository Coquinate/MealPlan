# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **PRIMARY:** Eliminate daily meal decision fatigue for urban Romanian families by providing complete weekly meal plans
- Save families 3+ hours weekly on meal planning, decision-making, and shopping optimization
- Reduce food waste by 50% through strategic batch cooking and leftover integration
- Cut monthly food expenses by reducing reliance on delivery apps (targeting 200-400 RON savings)
- Establish Coquinate as the definitive meal planning solution for modern Romanian families
- Achieve 300 paying subscribers by Month 3 with 30% trial-to-paid conversion

## Background Context

Coquinate addresses a critical pain point for dual-income urban Romanian families who face daily "Ce gÄƒtim azi?" decision paralysis. Currently, families spend 5-7 hours weekly on meal decisions and make 2-3 inefficient grocery trips, leading to excessive delivery app usage and 25% food waste. The platform delivers complete weekly meal plans (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) with intelligent 1-3 day batch cooking patterns that match how Romanian families actually cook.

Unlike competitors who only address dinner or offer generic international recipes, Coquinate provides culturally-relevant meal plans that strategically transform Sunday's roast into Monday's sandwiches and Tuesday's fried rice. At 50 RON/month, the service positions itself in a market with only one established local competitor (Georgiana Ilie's newsletter with 21,000 subscribers) and 4.8M potential users by 2028, creating a 12-18 month window before international players recognize this underserved market.
