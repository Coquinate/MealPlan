## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None identified

**HIGH:**

- Data migration strategy for initial 4 weeks of content not explicitly defined (implied in Story 3.17 but needs clarity)
- Technical risk areas for AI integration fallbacks could be more explicit

**MEDIUM:**

- Monitoring and alerting specifics beyond basic Vercel Analytics could be enhanced
- Support workflow for user issues not fully detailed

**LOW:**

- Stakeholder approval process not explicitly documented (single developer context makes this less critical)
- Some technical decision rationale could be expanded (though KISS principle justification is clear)

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Appropriately Scoped Features:**

- 3-day trial with fixed menu (smart simplification)
- Single pricing tier initially (50 RON/month)
- Admin dashboard with AI assistance (replaces need for domain experts)
- PWA instead of native apps (reduces complexity)
- Romanian-only for launch (with English structure ready)

**Potential Scope Reductions (if needed):**

- Push notifications (Story 7.4 already marked optional)
- Blog could launch with 3 articles instead of 5-10
- Annual subscription could be deferred to Month 2

**Complexity Concerns:** None - AI integration is well-planned with fallbacks

**Timeline Realism:** Achievable with focused execution and AI assistance

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:**

- ✅ Monorepo structure with pnpm
- ✅ Supabase + Vercel serverless architecture
- ✅ Tailwind v4 with semantic tokens only
- ✅ Vercel AI SDK with Gemini (avoiding complex features)
- ✅ Testing requirements (90%+ admin coverage)

**Identified Technical Risks:**

- AI API limits (mitigated with caching strategy)
- Stripe webhook reliability (standard patterns apply)
- Image optimization costs (Vercel free tier limits)

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**

- Optimal caching strategy implementation details
- Supabase RLS policies for multi-tenancy
- Service worker cache invalidation strategy

## Recommendations

1. **Add explicit data seeding plan** for initial 4 weeks of content in Epic 3
2. **Document monitoring beyond Vercel Analytics** - consider error tracking service
3. **Clarify support workflow** - even for solo operation, user issue handling is critical
4. **Consider phased AI rollout** - start with copy/paste, add API integration after launch

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The minor gaps identified do not block architecture work and can be addressed in parallel.
