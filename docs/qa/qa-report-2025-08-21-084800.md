**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3005
2. Open browser console
3. Observe repeated missing key warnings

**Actual Result:** 
- Console shows multiple warnings: "Missing translation key: landing:share.facebook for language: ro"
- Same for WhatsApp and Email share options
- Warnings repeat multiple times, indicating multiple instances of the share widget

**Expected Result:** 
- No missing translation warnings
- Proper Romanian text for share options

  ```

## Status Update for i18n Fix

✅ **MAIN ISSUE RESOLVED**: The critical i18n initialization problem has been completely fixed:
- No more "toResolveHierarchy" errors
- No more I18nProvider initialization errors
- Page loads cleanly with proper Romanian text
- i18next initializes correctly with debug logging

⚠️ **MINOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Missing translation keys for share widget functionality:
- `landing:share.facebook`
- `landing:share.whatsapp` 
- `landing:share.email`

**Recommendation**: Add the missing share translation keys to `packages/i18n/src/locales/ro/landing.json` to eliminate console warnings and ensure proper Romanian text for share functionality.

**Overall Assessment**: The main i18n fix was successful and the application is now fully functional.
