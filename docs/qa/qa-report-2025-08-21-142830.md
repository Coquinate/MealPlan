# Auditor Test Report

## Overall Status: MIXED

## Summary
Progress indicator component is partially functional with visual styling but has critical translation key issues and dynamic data problems.

---

## Passed Tests
- `Progress bar visual styling` - Gradient background from coral to primary colors is present
- `Icons rendering` - User icons and trending up icons are displaying correctly
- `Basic layout structure` - Component has proper card-like layout
- `Interactive elements` - Progress bar is functioning as a UI element

## Failed Tests

### Test: `Translation Keys Missing`

**Description:**
Multiple critical translation keys are missing for the progress indicator component, causing display of raw translation key names instead of Romanian text.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Scroll to progress indicator section
3. Observe the text content
- **Actual Result:** Text shows "progress.percentage_reserved" instead of Romanian translation
- **Expected Result:** Should display proper Romanian text like "rezervat" or "locuri rezervate"

**Evidence:**
- **Screenshot:** `/home/alexandru/Projects/MealPlan/.playwright-mcp/qa-progress-indicator-focused.png`
- **Console Logs:**
  ```
  [LOG] i18next::translator: missingKey ro landing progress.percentage_reserved progress.percentage_re...
  [WARNING] Missing translation key: landing:progress.percentage_reserved for language: ro
  ```

### Test: `Data Inconsistency in Progress Display`

**Description:**
The progress indicator shows conflicting data values between different sections of the component.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Examine the progress indicator section
3. Compare the displayed values
- **Actual Result:** Shows "27 din 500 locuri ocupate" but also "Doar 473 locuri rƒÉmase" and "5%" - these numbers don't add up correctly (27/500 = 5.4%, but 500-27=473 is correct)
- **Expected Result:** All numbers should be mathematically consistent

**Evidence:**
- **Screenshot:** `/home/alexandru/Projects/MealPlan/.playwright-mcp/qa-progress-indicator-focused.png`
- **Console Logs:**
  ```
  No specific errors, but mathematical inconsistency visible
  ```

### Test: `Share Widget Translation Keys Missing`

**Description:**
Multiple share widget components are missing Romanian translation keys, causing console warnings.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Open browser console
3. Observe translation warnings
- **Actual Result:** Console shows multiple missing translation warnings for share.facebook, share.whatsapp, share.email
- **Expected Result:** All share buttons should have proper Romanian translations

**Evidence:**
- **Screenshot:** `/home/alexandru/Projects/MealPlan/.playwright-mcp/qa-progress-indicator-analysis.png`
- **Console Logs:**
  ```
  [WARNING] Missing translation key: landing:share.facebook for language: ro
  [WARNING] Missing translation key: landing:share.whatsapp for language: ro
  [WARNING] Missing translation key: landing:share.email for language: ro
  ```

## Analysis Summary

### Visual Implementation ‚úÖ
The progress indicator component has successfully implemented:
- **Gradient Background**: Coral to primary color gradient is properly applied
- **Icons**: User icons (üë§) and trending icons (üìà) are rendering correctly
- **Compact Layout**: Component maintains a card-like, compact design that doesn't stretch across the page
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress bar element is present and styled

### Critical Issues ‚ùå
The component has several critical issues that need immediate attention:

1. **Translation Infrastructure**: Missing Romanian translation keys for `progress.percentage_reserved` and all share widget text
2. **Data Consistency**: Mathematical inconsistency in progress calculations (27/500 ‚â† 5% exactly)
3. **Console Warnings**: Multiple i18n warnings polluting the console output

### Romanian Language Context üá∑üá¥
The application correctly loads with Romanian language settings, but several key user-facing texts are not properly translated, affecting the user experience for Romanian users.

### Recommendations
1. **High Priority**: Add missing translation keys to `packages/i18n/src/locales/ro/landing.json`
2. **Medium Priority**: Fix mathematical consistency in progress calculations
3. **Low Priority**: Clean up console warnings for better debugging experience
