# Auditor Test Report

## Overall Status: MIXED

## Summary
Progress indicator width analysis reveals significant deviation from v0 design - current implementation spans full column width instead of compact design.

---

## Passed Tests
- Application loads successfully after UI package rebuild
- Progress indicator displays correctly with proper Romanian text
- Statistics section renders with proper formatting
- Email capture section functions properly

## Failed Tests

### Test: Progress Indicator Width Compliance

**Description:**
The progress indicator component does not match the v0 design specification. The current implementation spans the full width of the left column, whereas the v0 design shows a compact, content-width progress bar that aligns with the paragraph text width.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3004
2. Observe the progress indicator section below the statistics
3. Compare with v0 design mockup

- **Actual Result:** Progress indicator spans the full width of the left column container
- **Expected Result:** Progress indicator should have a compact width that matches the paragraph text width, similar to the v0 design

**Evidence:**
- **Screenshot:** /home/alexandru/Projects/MealPlan/.playwright-mcp/qa-progress-indicator-width-analysis.png
- **Visual Analysis:**
  - Current progress bar extends across the entire available width
  - Text "5% din locurile gratuite sunt deja rezervate" appears below a full-width progress bar
  - Container width is significantly wider than the paragraph text above
  - Does not match the compact, content-aligned design from v0 mockup

**Recommendations:**
1. Reduce progress indicator container width to match paragraph content width
2. Consider using `max-width` constraints or flexbox alignment
3. Ensure progress bar maintains visual hierarchy with surrounding text elements
4. Test responsive behavior at different viewport sizes

## Design System Compliance Notes

**Romanian Text Rendering:** ✅ PASSED
- All Romanian characters (ă, î, ș, ț) display correctly
- Diacritics are properly rendered throughout the interface

**Typography Hierarchy:** ✅ PASSED  
- Heading structure follows proper semantic markup
- Text sizing and spacing appear consistent with design tokens

**Color Implementation:** ✅ PASSED
- Design tokens are being used correctly
- Progress bar uses appropriate brand colors

**Component Spacing:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
- Progress indicator section needs width adjustment to match design intent
- Overall spacing looks consistent otherwise

## Priority Recommendations

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Adjust progress indicator width to match v0 compact design
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Verify responsive behavior across mobile/tablet viewports  
3. **LOW PRIORITY:** Consider adding subtle animations to progress bar updates
