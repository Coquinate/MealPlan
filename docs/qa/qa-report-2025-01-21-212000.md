## Test Results

### Test: `workflow_nodes_visibility_verification`

**Description:**
Verified that the WorkflowNodes component is visible on the landing page at http://localhost:3002 after fixing the missing `--workflow-min-height` design token.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3002
2. Locate the workflow visualization section on the right side of the hero
3. Verify the three workflow cards are visible with correct Romanian text
4. Confirm the container has proper minimum height

- **Actual Result:** ✅ All workflow cards are visible with correct text: "Gătești Duminică", "Refolosești Luni", "Reinventezi Marți"
- **Expected Result:** ✅ WorkflowNodes component should be visible with three workflow cards

**Evidence:**
- **Screenshot:** `/home/alexandru/Projects/MealPlan/.playwright-mcp/workflow-nodes-verification.png`
- **Container Analysis:**
  ```json
  {
    "containerFound": true,
    "hasMinHeightClass": true,
    "classes": "relative w-full h-full min-h-workflow-min flex justify-center items-center",
    "minHeight": "500px",
    "actualHeight": 500,
    "tagName": "DIV"
  }
  ```
- **Workflow Elements Found:** 3/3 cards detected with proper content

### Test: `tailwind_design_token_application`

**Description:**
Validated that the `min-h-workflow-min` Tailwind class is correctly applied and resolves to 500px minimum height.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Inspect the workflow container element
2. Verify the `min-h-workflow-min` class is present
3. Confirm the computed CSS `minHeight` property is "500px"
4. Check that the actual height matches the minimum requirement

- **Actual Result:** ✅ Class applied correctly, minHeight: "500px", actualHeight: 500px
- **Expected Result:** ✅ Container should have minimum height of 500px

### Test: `workflow_cards_content_verification`

**Description:**
Confirmed all three workflow cards display the correct Romanian text content.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Locate each workflow card in the DOM
2. Verify text content matches expected Romanian phrases
3. Confirm proper styling and positioning

- **Actual Result:** ✅ All cards found with correct content:
  - Card 1: "Gătești Duminică" - "Prepari o masă principală."
  - Card 2: "Refolosești Luni" - "Transformi într-un prânz rapid."
  - Card 3: "Reinventezi Marți" - "Creezi o cină nouă."
- **Expected Result:** ✅ Three workflow cards with Romanian cooking workflow descriptions

## Technical Summary

The issue was successfully resolved by adding the missing `--workflow-min-height: 500px` CSS custom property to the design tokens configuration. The WorkflowNodes component is now fully functional and visible on the landing page.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ WorkflowNodes component renders correctly
- ✅ Tailwind `min-h-workflow-min` class applies 500px minimum height
- ✅ All three workflow cards display with proper Romanian content
- ✅ Container maintains responsive layout and positioning
- ✅ Visual hierarchy and spacing work as intended

**Environment:**
- URL: http://localhost:3002
- Browser: Chromium via Playwright
- Resolution: Full page screenshot captured
- React Dev Tools: Active (development mode)

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Fixed**: Missing design token has been resolved
2. Consider adding E2E tests for WorkflowNodes component interactions
3. Verify responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
4. Test workflow animations and hover states if implemented
