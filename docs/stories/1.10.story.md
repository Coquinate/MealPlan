```

### Database Schema Integration

[Source: supabase/migrations/00003_ingredients_recipes.sql]

**Recipe Image Storage (Already Implemented):**

```sql
-- Recipes table (existing)
CREATE TABLE recipes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title_ro VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  title_en VARCHAR(255),
  instructions_ro TEXT NOT NULL,
  instructions_en TEXT,
  image_url TEXT,              -- Supabase Storage URL (already exists)
  status recipe_status_enum NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Image URL Format:**

- Storage bucket: `recipe-images`
- URL pattern: `https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/recipe-images/[recipe-id]/[filename]`
- Naming convention: `[recipe-id]-main.jpg` for primary recipe image
- Fallback handling: NULL image_url triggers fallback component behavior

### Coding Standards Integration

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Image Optimization Standards:**

- **Performance**: "Use Vercel Image for recipe photos" - mandatory for all recipe images
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor bundle size impact of image components for PWA performance
- **Lazy Loading**: React.lazy() pattern with Suspense boundaries for image components
- **Database Queries**: Avoid N+1 queries when loading recipe images in lists
- **Type Safety**: "NO ANY TYPES" - strict TypeScript interfaces for image props
- **No Hardcoded Text**: All image alt text through i18n system (Romanian only)

**Tailwind CSS v4 Image Standards:**

- **Design Tokens Only**: Use predefined aspect-ratio and size tokens for image containers
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind responsive classes for mobile/tablet/desktop image sizing
- **Component Classes**: Avoid utility soup - create component-based image classes
- **Custom Properties**: CSS custom properties for dynamic image dimensions

### Component Architecture Integration

[Source: architecture/components.md#file-storage]

**File Storage Component Integration:**

- **Responsibility**: Supabase Storage for recipe images and PDF exports
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - Authenticated upload/download URLs via Supabase client
  - Image transformation API through Vercel Image optimization
  - CDN distribution via Vercel Edge Network
- **Dependencies**: Auth service for access control (RLS policies)
- **Technology Stack**: Supabase Storage with built-in CDN

**Image Component Architecture:**

```typescript
// Image handling interfaces
interface RecipeImageProps {
  recipeId: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  alt: string;
  priority?: boolean;
  sizes?: string;
  className?: string;
}

interface ImageOptimizationConfig {
  quality: number;
  formats: ('webp' | 'avif' | 'jpeg')[];
  breakpoints: { mobile: number; tablet: number; desktop: number };
}
```

### Data Models Integration

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#recipe-model]

**Recipe Image Model:**

```typescript
interface Recipe {
  id: string;
  titleRo: string;
  titleEn: string;
  imageUrl?: string; // Supabase Storage URL or null for fallback
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// Image metadata handling
interface RecipeImageMetadata {
  originalUrl: string;
  optimizedUrl: string;
  blurDataUrl: string;
  altTextRo: string;
  altTextEn: string;
  dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
}
```

### Authentication & Security Integration

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#row-level-security-rls-policies]

**Image Access Security:**

- **Public Recipe Images**: Published recipes (status='published') have public image access
- **Draft Recipe Images**: Restricted to admin users only via RLS policies
- **Storage Bucket Policies**: Authenticated uploads, public reads for published content
- **CDN Security**: Vercel Edge Network respects Supabase auth policies

**Required RLS Policies for Storage:**

```sql
-- Allow public read access to recipe images
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for recipe images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'recipe-images');

-- Allow authenticated admin users to upload images
CREATE POLICY "Admin upload access for recipe images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'recipe-images' AND
  (auth.jwt() ->> 'role')::text = 'admin'
);

-- Allow authenticated admin users to update images
CREATE POLICY "Admin update access for recipe images"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'recipe-images' AND
  (auth.jwt() ->> 'role')::text = 'admin'
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'recipe-images' AND
  (auth.jwt() ->> 'role')::text = 'admin'
);

-- Allow authenticated admin users to delete images
CREATE POLICY "Admin delete access for recipe images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'recipe-images' AND
  (auth.jwt() ->> 'role')::text = 'admin'
);
```

### Performance Optimization Integration

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]

**Image Performance Requirements:**

- **Lazy Loading**: Intersection Observer for recipe image lazy loading
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor impact of image optimization libraries on PWA bundle
- **Database Queries**: Efficient recipe+image queries, avoid N+1 patterns
- **Edge Function Performance**: Optimize image-related API calls for minimal cold starts
- **Core Web Vitals**: Image optimization must improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

### Testing Requirements Integration

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Image Component Testing:**

- **Admin Dashboard Priority**: Test recipe image upload/management in admin interface (90% coverage)
- **Manual Testing**: Visual verification of image loading and responsive behavior
- **Performance Testing**: Core Web Vitals impact measurement
- **Accessibility Testing**: Alt text and screen reader compatibility

**Test Implementation Locations:**

```
apps/web/tests/
└── components/
    └── recipe-image.test.tsx  # RecipeImage component unit tests

apps/admin/tests/
└── features/
    └── image-upload.test.tsx  # Admin image upload functionality tests
```

### Error Handling Requirements

[Source: architecture/error-handling.md]

**Image Error Handling Strategy:**

- **404 Images**: Graceful fallback to placeholder image with Romanian styling
- **Upload Failures**: Clear error messages in Romanian via i18n system
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic for image uploads with exponential backoff
- **Format Errors**: Validation for image format, size, and dimensions before upload
- **CORS Errors**: Proper CORS configuration for browser-based uploads
- **Storage Quota**: Handle storage limit errors gracefully

**Required CORS Configuration for Supabase Storage:**

```json
{
  "allowedOrigins": [
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://localhost:3001",
    "https://yourdomain.com",
    "https://admin.yourdomain.com"
  ],
  "allowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
  "allowedHeaders": ["*"],
  "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
}
```

### Migration Strategy from Trial Menu Images

[From Story 1.9 Implementation]

**Current State**: Trial menu recipes reference placeholder image URLs in `/images/recipes/trial-[recipe-slug].jpg` format (URLs only, no actual files exist)
**Migration Path**:

1. Create actual recipe images or use high-quality Romanian food stock photos
2. Upload images to Supabase Storage `recipe-images` bucket
3. Update trial menu recipes with new Supabase Storage URLs
4. Implement fallback system for missing images
5. Document image requirements for future recipe additions

**Image Migration Script Requirements:**

```bash
# Create migration utility
pnpm create-script migrate-recipe-images

# Script should:
# 1. Read trial menu recipes from database
# 2. Download or create images for each recipe
# 3. Upload to Supabase Storage with proper naming
# 4. Update database records with new URLs
# 5. Verify all images load properly
```

### Next.js Image Configuration (Already Implemented)

[Source: apps/web/next.config.js]

**Current next.config.js Configuration:**

```javascript
// Image optimization already configured in project
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
    minimumCacheTTL: 31536000, // 1 year cache
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: '**.supabase.co', // Already configured for Supabase
        pathname: '/storage/v1/**',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

**Note:** Next.js image optimization is already properly configured. Task 2 will focus on Supabase Storage bucket setup rather than Next.js configuration.
