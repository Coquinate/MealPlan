### Next.js App Router Migration Requirements

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

**App Router Structure Migration (MVP-Focused):**

```typescript
// Current pages/ structure → New app/ structure (simplified)
pages/index.tsx → app/(marketing)/page.tsx
pages/auth/login.tsx → app/(marketing)/auth/login/page.tsx
pages/dashboard.tsx → app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx
pages/api/* → app/api/* (stays same)

// Route Group Layouts (2 only):
app/layout.tsx - Root layout with providers and RootErrorBoundary
app/(marketing)/layout.tsx - Marketing/landing/auth pages
app/(app)/layout.tsx - Authenticated user interface
// Skip app/(admin)/layout.tsx - add when admin features are built
```

**Route Group Benefits (MVP Context):**

- Supports Epic 2 marketing website requirements
- Clean separation between marketing and authenticated app
- Preserves existing authentication logic from middleware

### Error Handling Implementation Requirements (MVP-Focused)

[Source: architecture/error-handling.md - simplified for fast implementation]

**Error Page Structure (Hardcoded Romanian):**

```typescript
// app/error.tsx - Server error boundary
interface ErrorProps {
  error: Error & { digest?: string }
  reset: () => void
}

// app/not-found.tsx - 404 page (hardcoded for MVP)
const NotFound = () => {
  return (
    <div className="error-container">
      <Card>
        <h1>Pagina nu a fost găsită</h1>
        <p>Ne pare rău, pagina pe care o cauți nu există.</p>
        <Button href="/dashboard">Înapoi la panoul principal</Button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Error Boundary (Single Level Only):**

- RootErrorBoundary: App-wide error catching and recovery only
- Skip Feature/Component boundaries (enterprise complexity)

### Design System Integration (MVP-Focused)

[Source: architecture/components.md - simplified for fast implementation]

**Error Page Components (Hardcoded Text):**

```typescript
// Use existing design system components with hardcoded Romanian text
import { Button, Card } from '@coquinate/ui';

// Simplified error page - no i18n complexity for MVP
const ErrorPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className="error-page">
      <Card className="error-card">
        <h1 className="error-title">Ceva nu a mers bine</h1>
        <p className="error-description">Ne pare rău pentru inconvenient.</p>
        <div className="error-actions">
          <Button variant="primary">Încearcă din nou</Button>
          <Button variant="secondary" href="/dashboard">Înapoi acasă</Button>
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Design Token Usage (Simplified):**

- Use semantic design tokens only
- Skip CVA complexity for error pages (keep simple)
- Focus on functional error handling over perfect styling

### Text Content Strategy (MVP-Focused)

[Source: KISS principle - fast-to-market over i18n perfectionism]

**Hardcoded Romanian Text for MVP:**

```typescript
// Skip i18n complexity for error pages initially
// Hardcode Romanian text directly in components

const errorTexts = {
  notFound: {
    title: 'Pagina nu a fost găsită',
    description: 'Ne pare rău, pagina pe care o cauți nu există.',
    goHome: 'Înapoi la panoul principal',
  },
  serverError: {
    title: 'Eroare de server',
    description: 'Ceva nu a mers bine. Încearcă din nou.',
    tryAgain: 'Încearcă din nou',
  },
  maintenance: {
    title: 'În mentenanță',
    description: 'Aplicația este temporar indisponibilă.',
    backSoon: 'Revenim în curând!',
  },
};
```

**Rationale:**

- Error pages are rarely seen by users
- i18n adds development complexity with minimal MVP value
- Can migrate to i18n later when you have international users

### Middleware Updates for App Router (Minimal Changes)

[Source: existing apps/web/src/middleware.ts analysis]

**Current Middleware Status:**

- Comprehensive authentication system already implemented
- Route protection rules already work with App Router structure
- Existing path matching supports nested routes
- No changes needed to route arrays - current paths work with both systems

**Minimal Updates Required:**

```typescript
// Current middleware already supports:
// '/' -> works with app/(marketing)/page.tsx
// '/auth/login' -> works with app/(marketing)/auth/login/page.tsx
// '/dashboard' -> works with app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx

// No changes needed to routeConfig - existing paths work fine
// Route groups are invisible to middleware (that's their purpose)
```

**Implementation Strategy:**

- Test existing middleware with App Router migration
- Only fix if authentication actually breaks
- Preserve all existing logic (admin checks, subscription validation, etc.)

### Layout Hierarchy Implementation (MVP-Simplified)

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md - streamlined for fast development]

**Layout Component Structure (2 Levels Only):**

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx - Root Layout
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="ro">
      <body>
        <RootErrorBoundary>
          <SupabaseProvider>
            {children}
          </SupabaseProvider>
        </RootErrorBoundary>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

// app/(marketing)/layout.tsx - Marketing Layout (simplified)
export default function MarketingLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <div className="marketing-layout">
      <header>Coquinate</header>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}

// app/(app)/layout.tsx - App Layout (simplified)
export default function AppLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <div className="app-layout">
      <nav>Dashboard Navigation</nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Testing Requirements (MVP-Focused)

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - simplified for MVP velocity]

**Essential Testing Only:**

- Single Playwright E2E test: `apps/web/tests/routing-errors.spec.ts`
- Manual verification during development
- Deployment smoke test

**E2E Test Scope:**

```typescript
// apps/web/tests/routing-errors.spec.ts
test.describe('MVP Error Handling', () => {
  test('error pages accessible and auth redirects work', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test 404 page displays
    // Test auth redirect with App Router
    // Test maintenance mode toggle
  });
});
```

### Environment Variable Configuration

[Source: Epic 1.8 AC #7 - Maintenance Mode]

**Environment Variables Required:**

```env
# Maintenance Mode Toggle (CREATE)
MAINTENANCE_MODE=false
MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE_RO="Aplicația este în mentenanță"
MAINTENANCE_ETA="2 ore"

# Error Tracking Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://coquinate.com
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@coquinate.com

# Existing variables (maintained)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

    └── dashboard/page.tsx        # Dashboard (migrated from pages/dashboard.tsx)
```

**Key Components Implemented:**

- `RootErrorBoundary.tsx` - App-wide error catching with Romanian error messages
- All error pages use hardcoded Romanian text as specified for MVP
- Route groups are invisible to middleware - no middleware changes needed
- Old pages/ files removed to prevent conflicts

**Environment Variables Added:**

- `MAINTENANCE_MODE` - Toggle for maintenance mode
- `MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE_RO` - Romanian maintenance message
- `MAINTENANCE_ETA` - Estimated return time
- `SUPPORT_EMAIL` - Support contact for error pages

### Debug Log

**Migration Process:**

1. ✅ Created app/ directory structure with route groups
2. ✅ Migrated all pages from pages/ to app/ directory
3. ✅ Converted pages to App Router format (client components, removed metadata from client components)
4. ✅ Created layout hierarchy (root → marketing → app)
5. ✅ Implemented error pages with Romanian text
6. ✅ Created RootErrorBoundary component
7. ✅ Added maintenance mode page
8. ✅ Removed conflicting old pages/ files
9. ⚠️ Build testing revealed React context issues (likely in shared packages)

**Technical Notes:**

- Landing page required 'use client' directive and metadata removal
- TypeScript error fixed with proper translations typing
- Middleware preserved as-is (route groups are transparent to routing)
- Build warnings about Supabase Edge Runtime compatibility (non-blocking)

### File List
