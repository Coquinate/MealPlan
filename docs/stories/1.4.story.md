## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[From Story 1.3]

- Design system and component library established in packages/ui
- ESLint token enforcement rules already configured in packages/config/eslint/design-tokens.js
- Monorepo structure working with pnpm workspaces
- TypeScript strict mode configured across packages
- Build pipeline established with tsup for packages

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **i18n Framework**: i18next v24.x - React 19 compatible internationalization
- **React Integration**: react-i18next v15.6.1 - Proven solution with SSR support
- **TypeScript**: 5.9.x for type-safe translations
- **Build Tools**: Existing tsup configuration for package building
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10.14.0 for monorepo management

```

### Coding Standards Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Critical Rule**: "No Hardcoded Text: Use the I18n system, romanian only"
- All user-facing text must use translation keys
- Romanian is the only active language (English structure for future)
- JSDoc required for vital functions (formatting utilities)
- Type safety required - no any types allowed

### Frontend Architecture Integration

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md - note: file reference not verified during validation]

- Components use coordination hooks pattern
- i18n should integrate seamlessly with existing hooks
- Translation loading states should coordinate with component loading
- SSR compatibility required for Next.js applications
- Components organized by feature - translations should match

### ESLint Configuration Requirements

[Source: packages/config/eslint/design-tokens.js - verified from source-tree.md]

- Existing ESLint configuration blocks arbitrary Tailwind values
- Need to add react/jsx-no-literals rule
- Must coordinate with existing design token enforcement
- Should not conflict with Radix UI permitted patterns

### Security Considerations & Requirements

[Source: Coding standards and security best practices]

- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize any user-provided parameters before interpolation in translations
- **Input Validation**: Basic validation of translation parameters to prevent injection
- **Safe Defaults**: Use safe fallback text when translation content is suspicious or fails validation

### Romanian Localization Requirements

[Source: Story 1.3 completion notes]

- Romanian formatting utilities already partially implemented for design system
- 24-hour time format standard
- Week starts on Monday
- Currency: RON (Lei) with proper suffix positioning
- Date format: DD.MM.YYYY
- Number format: 1.234,56 (dot for thousands, comma for decimals)

### Namespace Structure Design

Based on application features:

- **common**: Shared UI elements, buttons, navigation, errors, loading states
- **auth**: Login, register, password reset, session management
- **meals**: Meal planning, week view, today view, meal cards
- **shopping**: Shopping list, categories, items, stores
- **admin**: Recipe management, meal plan creation, analytics
- **recipes**: Recipe details, ingredients, instructions, nutrition
- **settings**: User preferences, household settings, subscription

### Translation Key Naming Convention

Following TypeScript interface patterns:

```
namespace.feature.element.state
Examples:
- common.button.save
- meals.weekView.title
- shopping.item.checked
- admin.recipe.validation.error
```

### Error Handling & Resilience Requirements

[Source: Production reliability best practices]

- **Missing Translations**: Show English fallback or display the translation key itself
- **Loading Failures**: App continues functioning with fallback text, console warning for debugging
- **Invalid Parameters**: Sanitize inputs, show safe fallback content instead of breaking

### Critical Implementation Notes

- i18next v24.x has breaking changes from v23 - check migration guide
- react-i18next v15.6.1 requires React 18+ (we have React 19.1.0)
- SSR requires special handling in Next.js App Router
- Translation keys must be statically analyzable for type generation
- Avoid dynamic key construction for better type safety

## Testing

### Testing Requirements for This Story

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit tests for formatting utilities using Vitest
