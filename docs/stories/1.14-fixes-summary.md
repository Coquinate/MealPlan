**Implementation:**

- Zod schema definitions for all API responses
- Runtime validation with detailed error reporting
- Sanitization capabilities
- Validated API client wrapper
- React hook for validated API calls
- Middleware for API routes

## Testing Checklist

### Security Testing

- [ ] Test CSRF protection on state-changing admin operations
- [ ] Verify session timeout after 2 hours of inactivity
- [ ] Confirm session expiration after 24 hours
- [ ] Test CSRF token rotation and cleanup
- [ ] Verify Origin/Referer validation in production

### Storage & Performance Testing

- [ ] Test localStorage quota handling when near limit
- [ ] Verify emoji/special character size calculations
- [ ] Test automatic space cleanup strategies
- [ ] Monitor memory usage over extended periods
- [ ] Verify timeout cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Error Handling Testing

- [ ] Test cache error boundary with quota exceeded errors
- [ ] Verify retry mechanism works correctly
- [ ] Test fallback UI displays properly
- [ ] Confirm error logging to monitoring service
- [ ] Test recovery from cache failures

### Data Validation Testing

- [ ] Test API response validation with malformed data
- [ ] Verify validation errors are properly handled
- [ ] Test sanitization of unknown fields
- [ ] Confirm TypeScript types match runtime validation
