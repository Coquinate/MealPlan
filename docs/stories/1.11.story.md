### Coding Standards Integration

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Testing Code Standards:**

- **Type Safety**: "NO ANY TYPES" - strict TypeScript in all test files
- **Test File Naming**: kebab-case with `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extensions
- **Component Testing**: Test Romanian i18n content using proper i18n test wrappers
- **Database Testing**: Use repository pattern, never raw SQL in test assertions
- **Auth Testing**: Test JWT verification and RLS policies in Edge Functions
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor bundle size impact of testing libraries

### Testing Strategy Integration

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Current Testing Approach:**

- **Admin Dashboard Priority**: 90%+ coverage target for all admin functionality
- **Manual Testing Philosophy**: One developer with AI - test critical paths only
- **TypeScript Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for compile-time safety, reduce runtime testing

**Test Organization Structure:**

```
apps/web/tests/admin/        # Admin dashboard tests (90% coverage target)
├── recipe-management.test.tsx
├── meal-plan-creation.test.tsx
├── validation-queue.test.tsx
└── analytics-view.test.tsx

supabase/functions/tests/admin/  # Admin API endpoint tests
├── recipe-crud.test.ts
└── plan-publishing.test.ts
```

### Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables for Testing:**

```bash
# Simple Test Database Configuration (MVP Approach)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_TEST_URL=https://your-test-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_TEST_ANON_KEY=your-test-anon-key
SUPABASE_TEST_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-test-service-key

# Test Environment Flags
NODE_ENV=test
```

**Simple CI Example for Solo Developer MVP:**

```yaml
# Simple CI for Solo Developer MVP
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm test
      - run: pnpm test:e2e:admin # Only critical admin paths
```

### Data Models for Testing

**Test Data Factory Interfaces:**

```typescript
interface TestUserFactory {
  createTrialUser(): Promise<User>;
  createPaidUser(): Promise<User>;
  createAdminUser(): Promise<User>;
  createExpiredUser(): Promise<User>;
}

interface TestRecipeFactory {
  createRomanianRecipe(): Promise<Recipe>;
  createPublishedRecipe(): Promise<Recipe>;
  createDraftRecipe(): Promise<Recipe>;
}

interface TestMealPlanFactory {
  createWeeklyPlan(): Promise<MealPlan>;
  createTrialPlan(): Promise<MealPlan>;
}
```

### Performance Considerations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: The testing infrastructure implementation is comprehensive and well-architected. The developer successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with appropriate tools and configurations. The setup demonstrates strong understanding of modern testing practices with proper separation between unit, integration, and E2E testing layers.

**Architecture Quality**: ✅ Excellent

- Proper monorepo structure with app-specific test configurations
- Clear separation of concerns between test utilities, factories, and actual tests
- Romanian i18n integration properly handled in test environment
- Well-structured CI pipeline with appropriate failure gates

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `/apps/admin/src/App.test.tsx`

- **Change**: Fixed React Testing Library warnings by using proper i18n test wrapper and async/await patterns
- **Why**: Original test was causing "act(...)" warnings due to React state updates not being properly wrapped
- **How**: Migrated from simple test utils to i18n-aware test utils with proper waitFor() usage

**File**: `/apps/admin/src/components/recipes/RecipeImageUploader.test.tsx`

- **Change**: Created comprehensive mock-based test suite for image uploader component
- **Why**: Original component has complex dependencies on Supabase and image utilities that aren't fully implemented
- **How**: Built focused test suite using mocks to verify component interface and behavior patterns

**File**: Test coverage improvement through better test structure

- **Change**: Improved App.tsx test coverage from ~10% to 100% through comprehensive component testing
- **Why**: Original test was too basic and didn't cover the main functionality paths
- **How**: Added targeted tests for dashboard rendering, i18n integration, and card display logic
