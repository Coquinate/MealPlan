# Monitoring

## Minimal Monitoring (As Per PRD)

**What We Use:**

- Vercel Analytics (free tier) - basic page views only
- Vercel's built-in error tracking
- Supabase Dashboard for database monitoring

**What We Track:**

- Page views
- Web Vitals (automatic with Vercel)
- Errors in production (automatic with Vercel)

**What We Don't Need:**

- Custom metrics
- Complex dashboards
- Third-party monitoring services
- Detailed performance tracking

**Note:** PRD explicitly states "No complex analytics (just basic page views)" and "Minimal Vercel Analytics for page views only (free tier)"
