## Technical Notes

- **Issue Resolved**: Server import errors for `@coquinate/ui` package were fixed by rebuilding the UI library after correcting syntax errors in `LogoQDots.tsx`
- **Test Coverage**: Verified across three browser configurations (Firefox, Chromium, Mobile Chrome)
- **Component Detection**: While `data-testid` was not found, Romanian text content confirmed WorkflowTimeline presence
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Component renders correctly on mobile viewport (375x667px)

## Next Steps

- Consider adding `data-testid="workflow-timeline"` to WorkflowTimeline component for more reliable test targeting
- Component is functioning correctly on mobile as expected after resolving build issues
