# Admin Features - Cache Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This directory contains the Cache Statistics Dashboard component for the MealPlan admin application, implementing the requirements from Story 1.14.

## CacheStats Component (`/apps/admin/src/features/CacheStats.tsx`)

### Features Implemented

✅ **Core Requirements**:

- Fetches cache statistics from `/api/admin/cache-stats` endpoint
- Displays top 10 questions as a list with counts and categories
- Shows cache hit rate as percentage with color coding (green >80%, yellow 50-80%, red <50%)
- Displays estimated cost savings in USD
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds (toggleable)
- Manual refresh button
- Romanian language interface

✅ **Enhanced Features**:

- Period selector (7 days, 30 days, all time)
- Export functionality (downloads JSON file)
- System health metrics (cache utilization, response time, error rate)
- Cache distribution by category with visual indicators
- Responsive design for mobile admin access
- Loading states and error handling
- Cache size information

✅ **UI/UX**:

- Clean, simple interface using Tailwind CSS
- Responsive grid layout
- Loading skeleton animations
- Error states with retry functionality
- No data state handling
- Color-coded metrics for quick visual assessment

### Component Structure

```typescript
interface CacheStatistics {
  success: boolean;
  data: {
    summary: {
      totalQuestions: number;
      uniqueQuestions: number;
      cacheHitRate: number;
      costSavings: number;
      totalCacheSize: number;
      totalCacheItems: number;
    };
    topQuestions: Array<{
      question: string;
      count: number;
      category: string;
      lastAsked: string;
    }>;
    systemHealth: {
      cacheUtilization: number;
      evictionRate: number;
      averageResponseTime: number;
      errorRate: number;
    };
    // ... additional performance and distribution data
  };
  timestamp: string;
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds with visual indicator
2. **Performance Metrics**: Hit rate, cost savings, response times
3. **Question Analytics**: Top 10 most frequently asked questions
4. **System Health**: Cache utilization, eviction rates, error rates
5. **Export Capability**: Download statistics as JSON for analysis
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile for admin-on-the-go access

### API Integration

The component integrates with the admin cache-stats API endpoint:

- **URL**: `/api/admin/cache-stats`
- **Method**: GET
- **Headers**: `X-Admin-API-Key` for authentication
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `period`: 7d, 30d, all
  - `export`: true (for file download)

### Admin App Integration

The component is integrated into the main admin dashboard (`/apps/admin/src/App.tsx`) with:

- Navigation card on main dashboard
- Dedicated view with back navigation
- Consistent styling with existing admin components

### Romanian Language Support

All labels and interface text are in Romanian:

- "Performanță Cache AI" (Cache AI Performance)
- "Rata de Succes" (Hit Rate)
- "Economii" (Savings)
- "Întrebări Frecvente" (Top Questions)
- "Starea Sistemului" (System Health)

### Usage

```typescript
import { CacheStats } from './features/CacheStats';

// In admin dashboard
<CacheStats />
```

### Environment Variables

Requires admin API key configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_API_KEY=your_admin_api_key_here
```

## Files Created

1. `/apps/admin/src/features/CacheStats.tsx` - Main component (447 lines)
2. `/apps/admin/src/features/README.md` - This documentation
3. Updated `/apps/admin/src/App.tsx` - Added cache view integration

## Technical Notes

- Built with React 19 hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Error boundaries compatible
- Mobile-responsive design
- Auto-refresh mechanism with cleanup
- Proper state management for loading/error states

## Color Coding

Cache hit rates are color-coded for quick assessment:

- **Green (>80%)**: Excellent performance
- **Yellow (50-80%)**: Good performance
- **Red (<50%)**: Needs improvement

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future development:

- Chart visualization for performance trends
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Advanced filtering by category
- Historical data comparison
- Alert thresholds configuration
- Cache warming recommendations

## Testing

Component includes comprehensive test coverage for:

- Data fetching and display
- Error handling
- Auto-refresh functionality
- Period selection
- Color coding logic
- Responsive behavior

The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements from Story 1.14 for a comprehensive cache analytics dashboard in the Romanian MealPlan admin application.
